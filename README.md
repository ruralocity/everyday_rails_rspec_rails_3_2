Sample Rails 3.2.x application for [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec: A Practical Approach to Test-driven Development](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) by Aaron Sumner. This repository demonstrates incremental testing of an existing application, starting with an untested codebase and working through model, controller, and feature specs.

Each chapter's progress has a specific branch in this repository:

- `01_untested`: The initial, untested application.
- `02_setup`: Installation and configuration of the testing tools.
- `03_models`: Basics of model specs.
- `04_factories`: Use of factories to simplify test data creation.
- `06_controllers`: Basics of controller specs.
- `07_controller_cleanup`: Refactoring of controller specs.
- `08_features`: Use of Capybara in RSpec feature specs.
- `09_speedup`: Techniques of running specs more quickly.

Using Git, you can check out each version by name. See details in the book.

If you're not comfortable with Git, you can also use GitHub's handy branch/tag filter to select a specific tag and browse the source code online. To learn more about Git, I recommend [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/).
